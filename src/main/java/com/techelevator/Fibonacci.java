 The Fibonacci numbers are the integers in the following sequence:  
	0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
 By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
 
 Write a command line program which displays a Fibonacci sequence to the console. The program accepts an integer value as a command line 
 argument which specifies when to terminate the Fibonacci sequence, and quit the program.
  
 $ java Fiboncci 25
 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
